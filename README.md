# cardxchange

_The self-updating address book_

A service to exchange address data and keep them updated automagically - in my local contacts.

## Phase 0: Shows me linkedIn changes 

- A web app that shows me the changes in my contact crowd from last month / week / day.
- Easier to build b/o web - but needs local storage (maybe).

## Phase 1: Sync LinkedIn to my local contact

- An iOS App, maybe also macOS
- Enter your linkedIn credentials, then show you every day a list of data that changed within your linkedIn friends
	- Per change select
		- Apply these changes (to my local contacts)
		- Apply all changes automatically (also in the future)
		- Skip these changes
		- Skip all changes of this contact (also in the future)
	- And a check box "Do not inform me about changes of this contact anymore"
